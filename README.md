# Quicklab Event Talks App

This repository contains the source code for a single-page website that displays the schedule for a one-day technical event.

The website is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A Node.js script is used to compile the source files into a single, serverless `index.html` file located in the `dist` directory.
